# Transfer Learning Algorithms for EEG-based BCI

Welcome! This repo aims to achieve simple contemporary deep transfer learning for EEG analysis.  
The official implementation of our paper [`T-TIME: Test-Time Information Maximization Ensemble for Plug-and-Play BCIs`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10210666) (**IEEE TBME, 2023**)

## Steps for Usage:

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Install Conda dependencies based on  `environment.yml` file.

#### 2. Download Datasets

To download datasets, run   
```sh 
sh prepare_data.sh
```   

#### (Optional) 3. Training Source Subject Models

We have provided the source models (baseline source-combined EA+EEGNet) under ./runs, but feel free to train them from scratch.  
To train your own source models, run   
```sh 
sh train.sh
```   
or   
```sh 
python ./tl/dnn.py
```  

Note that such source models serve as EEGNet baselines, and are also used in SFUDA and TTA approaches as the initializations. So to save time for TTA/SFUDA for target subject adaptation, it is better to have them ready first.  

#### 4. Transfer Learning for Target Subject

To test the T-TIME algorithm, run   
```sh 
sh test.sh
```   
or   
```sh 
python ./tl/ttime.py
```   

Other approaches can be executed in a similar way. Run any of   
```sh 
python ./tl/*.py
```   
for its corresponding results.

Note that ensemble is seperated. For ensemble results, after running T-TIME, run  
```sh 
python ./tl/ttime_ensemble.py
```   

For CSP approach, it is not a deep learning approach and is seperated from the others. Run   
```sh 
python ./ml/feature.py
```

## Hyperparameters

Most hyperparameters/configurations of approaches/experiments are under the *args* variable in the "main" function of each file, and naming should be self-explanatory.
